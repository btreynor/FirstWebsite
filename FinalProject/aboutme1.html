		<summary class='details'><strong>Who Am I?</strong></summary>
			<p>My name is Brendan Treynor and I am 34-years-old, Army Veteran, CIS major, undergrad, and a proud father from Norfolk, Virgina.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary class='details'><strong>What is my Passion?</strong></summary>
			<p>What is my passion? Well, first let us define passion as an intense desire for someone or something.  With that being said, I have many passions.  I am passionate about getting my bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Systems with the best possible grade-point-average that I can achieve.  Secondly, and more importantly, my greatest passion, is being a father.  Having my daughter has brought me so much joy in life that I never thought I would be able to experience again.  It is through her that drives all of the other enthusiasms, ambitions, and goals that I have in my life.  It is because of her that I succeed.</p>

		<summary class='details'><strong>What is my Purpose?</strong></summary>
			<p>My purpose in life revolves around Jasmine.  This one tiny person, that shares my blood, my flesh, my being.  Being the best father that I can be.  Supporting, listening, loving, everything my father was not, I will be for her.  When her first boyfriend breaks her heart, daddy will be there.  When she has her first day of high school, I will be there.  There is nothing in this world that defines me living more than her.</p>

		<summary class='details'><strong>What are my strengths?</strong></dt></summary>
		<p>Ah, time to toot my own horn I see.  My intelligence is both a strength and a weakness, but I do not think this is the time or place to explain why.  I do believe that my ability to see how different situations will turn out is a strength.  What I mean by that is:  normally, with people, you can almost always tell how a person will react to things if you just pay attention to minor details, or if you are a cynic who does not expect people to surprise you by going a different route.  It makes sense to me, that is all that matters (Hah!).  Finally, my perseverance, the ability to adapt and overcome even the harshest of situations without succumbing to a nervous break or quitting is one of my finest strengths.  You may knock me down, but I am never down for the count.</p>

	<details>
		<summary class='details'><strong>What are my Weaknesses?</strong></summary>
		<p>Too many to count.  My stubbornness, my anger issues, and the way I play the victim are definitive weaknesses of mine that I have been trying to overcome.  I tend to block people out, even friends or family get the cold shoulder.  I am forgetful, I lie when I do not need to, and my alcoholism.  Lastly, my bluntness and honesty tend to be weaknesses some of the time because I tend to be blunt and honest at the most inopportune times.  These are not weaknesses that plague me every day to the point where I just curl up in the fetal position all day scared to face the world.  I am just old enough to recognize my flaws, accept them, and accept the fact that in order to be a better person and father, that change needs to happen.</p>

		<summary class='details'><strong>What are my Career Goals?</strong></summary>
		<p>My career goals involve being a software developer for the video game industry.  That is as far as I have gotten with it as life has thrown many different possibilities, but none that I think I would enjoy doing as a career.  With my major I could be a web manager as well or a data analyst, but I have not gotten that far into my classes to make a distinct choice.  With that being said, the one focal point for my major that most attracted me was software developer.  I love coding and programming things to do things I want on a computer; and to make someone’s vision come to fruition, especially as a video game, would be amazing.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary class='details'><strong>What is some interesting information known about this career?</strong></summary>
		<p>After researching, I have found that the median salary for a software developer to be $110K.  California has the most software developers, but the northeast of the country has the most demand; with Virginia, Maryland and Washington D.C. having the highest need for software developers respectively.  To caveat, with COVID-19, freelance software developers are becoming more and more accepted and are sometimes more lucrative than working with just one company.  As far as being successful, that, all depends on how proficient you are.  Do you have the ambition to succeed?  To adapt and change with the constant changes in technology?  You can be successful anywhere, at anything, with a positive outlook, high work ethic, confidence and ambition to be the best.</p>

		<summary class='details'><strong>What academic major is important to help me accomplish my career goals?</strong></summary>
		<p>A major in Computer Information Systems/Computer Science is the most important piece of paper that I will need to accomplish my career goals; however, many different certificates in JavaScript, C+, and etcetera for my portfolio can always help.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary class='details'><strong>What about me makes me a good-fit for this career?</strong></summary>
		<p>I believe I am best suited to pursue this career due to the simple fact that I love the world of video games.  I am very tech savvy as well.  This coupled with the fact that I have had a similar job in the military, and I know I would flourish.</p>
